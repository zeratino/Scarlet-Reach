// Stats-boosting food for adventurers / other alike. Currently there's very few good preserved food items that also give foodbuffs.
// This is a flavorful way to provide more reasons for adventurers to buy from innkeep instead of doing their own raisins.
// FOR GODS SAKE DO NOT GIVE THIS ROUNDSTART TO ANYONE BUT INNKEEP ON MAP.
